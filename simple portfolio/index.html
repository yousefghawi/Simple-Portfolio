      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a passionate, self-motivated developer based in Tulkarm-Palestine with a strong interest in user interface design,
        front-end development, and creative problem-solving.
        I started learning web development through online resources and quickly fell in love with bringing ideas to life using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy reading, exploring new technologies, and participating in developer communities.
        I believe learning never stops, and I’m constantly seeking new challenges that help me grow as both a developer and a person.
